# Item 1 - An IDE is a software hat allows you to write and compile code.

# Item 2 - We created all he folders/directories o differenciate all the programs and exercises.

# Item 3 - It is a good habit to have names that makes sense, because i helps other developers to 
#           understand the code.

# Item 4 - The Area of the circle is 452.3893421169302

# Item 5 - The circuference of the circle is 75.39822368615503

# Item 6 - I changed the type of the variable radius, the console prints out the TypeError: 
#           unsupported operand type(s) for ** or pow(): 'str' and 'int'
#           Note: If I remove the radius variable after the code has already being running, 
#           the code still runs fine.
